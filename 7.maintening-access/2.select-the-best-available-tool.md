### Select The Best Available Tool

#### Description
All well known covert communication techniques have a multitude of tools to choose from. The assessor must decide the right tool on the basis of the purpose for which it will be used and any other performance requirement. For example for large data transfer e.g. files, HTTP based covert channels are the best counterpart. For performance based issues we can use ICMP based covert channels. For security issues we can use SSL-tunneling.
