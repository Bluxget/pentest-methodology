### Active OS Guessing - Banner Grabbing Analysis And Correlation

#### Objectives
Banner analysis and correlation with other information gathered from scanning test will provide attackers and assessors valuable information to focus further tests and decide where manual tests for vulnerabilities (usually related to configuration issues) should take place. 

#### Tools
* Spreadsheets
* Databases
* Logic programming languages (e.g. Prolog)

#### Examples
Fill in a matrix information for each server for correlation, including:
* Service type
* Banner
* Service brand
* Service version

Identify false positives and mark their (probable) cause.

Search the Internet for relevant information on these services and include the following information:
* Known vulnerabilities
* Configuration issues or parameters that you might want to test further
