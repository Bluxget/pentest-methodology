# Network Mapping
## Determine Running Services
### Banner Grabbing / Service Fingerprinting

#### Objectives
Banner grabbing will give you a list of all open ports with the associated services running behind these open ports.
This could also tell you what operating system is in use on the target system.

#### Tools
* Grabbb
* Languard
* Nmap
* Amap
* Netcat
* telnet

#### Examples
```bash
$ nc -vv www.target.com 80
