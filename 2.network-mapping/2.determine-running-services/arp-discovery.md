# Network Mapping
## Determine Running Services
### ARP Discovery (Only on LAN)

#### Objectives
Once an attacker or assessor has gained access to a LAN, ARP discovery will give them the MAC address of the system. Several hijacking attacks and denial of service can take place under this situation.

#### Tools
* Arping
* Arpwatch
* Arp + protocol analyzer

#### Examples
```bash
$ arping 10.0.0.1

ARPING 10.0.0.1 from 10.0.0.100 eth0 
Unicast reply from 10.0.0.1 [DE:30:3A:CA:D4:44]  1.584ms 
Unicast reply from 10.0.0.1 [DE:30:3A:CA:D4:44]  0.863ms 
Unicast reply from 10.0.0.1 [DE:30:3A:CA:D4:44]  0.863ms
