# Network Mapping
## Identify Perimeter Network
### Scan Default Firewall/Router Ports

#### Objectives
Firewall administration ports, even if they use strong authentication algorithms, should never be available from outside the corporate network. Ports that identify the brand/version of a firewall should be filtered and banners (e.g. from application proxies) should be changed if possible to make firewall fingerprinting more difficult.

Being able to access and administration port or just being able to identify the firewall brand and version doesnâ€™t mean it is vulnerable. However, we are talking about the most widely used, effective, and sometimes the only type of defense used in networks the impact of a glitch in this kind of security controls is so big, that even these simple recommendations should be taken seriously, in this case. 

#### Tools
* Netcat
* hping
* Nmap

#### Examples
* Perform Port Scanning (SYN, ACK, FIN, XMAS, UDP, NULL) and OS guessing with port scanner or manual scanning procedures.
* Using common server ports (e.g. 53, 80. 443) as source ports will yield better results against stateless firewalls. Analysis/Conclusion/Observation.
