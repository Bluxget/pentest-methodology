# Network Mapping
## Identify Perimeter Network
### Perform FIN/ACK Scan

#### Objectives
The results of a FIN/ACK Scan alone are not enough to determine if a given port is open, but can help to identify the status of ports when combined with other scan types in the case of a firewall allowing packets with the FIN/ACK flag combination through.

#### Tools
* Nmap (the scan can be implemented with other tools such as hping2) 

#### Examples
1) System has port 80 open, port 81 closed, BSD-based, no firewall in front of it:
```bash
$ nmap -sM -p80,81 192.168.1.1

Starting  Nmap  4.01  (  http://www.insecure.org/nmap  )  at  2006-02-25  12:03  GMT Standard Time
Interesting ports on 192.168.1.1: 
PORT   STATE         SERVICE 
80/tcp open|filtered http 
81/tcp closed        hosts2-ns 

Nmap finished: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.113 seconds 
```

2) System has port 80 open, port 81 closed, BSD based, firewall drops packets to port 81:
```bash
$ nmap -sM -p80,81 192.168.1.2

Starting  Nmap  4.01  (  http://www.insecure.org/nmap  )  at  2006-02-25  12:08 GMT Standard Time
Interesting ports on 192.168.1.2: 
PORT   STATE         SERVICE 
80/tcp open|filtered http 
81/tcp open|filtered hosts2-ns 

Nmap finished: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.195 seconds 
```

3) System has port 80 open, port 81 closed, not BSD based, no firewall in front of it:
```bash
$ nmap -sM -p80,81 192.168.1.3

Starting  Nmap  4.01  (  http://www.insecure.org/nmap  )  at  2006-02-25  12:10GMT Standard Time
Interesting ports on 192.168.1.3: 
PORT   STATE  SERVICE 
80/tcp closed http 
81/tcp closed hosts2-ns 
Nmap finished: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.185 seconds 
```

4) System has port 80 open, port 81 closed, not BSD based, firewall drops packets to port 81:
```bash
$ nmap -sM -p80,81 192.168.1.4

Starting  Nmap  4.01  (  http://www.insecure.org/nmap  )  at  2006-02-25  12:15GMT Standard Time
Interesting ports on 192.168.1.4: 
PORT   STATE         SERVICE 
80/tcp closed        http 
81/tcp open|filtered hosts2-ns 

Nmap finished: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.387 seconds 
```
