* Network map
* Number and kind of services available
	* Indicate the permeability of the network
	* Indicate the complexity of the network
	* Indicate the core business network services

#### Tools
* Firewalk
* Ftester
* Netcat
* Nmap
* Amap

#### Examples
Map firewall and router rules using the following guidelines:
* For each open service found, create document an accept rule 
* For each rule, try to map their restrictions (e.g. IP address restrictions) 
* Also, using banners, try to identify and document if open services are behind proxies or not (e.g. conflicting reports for O.S. and application identification usually mean proxied services)
