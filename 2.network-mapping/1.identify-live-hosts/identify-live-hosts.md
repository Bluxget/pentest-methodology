# Network Mapping
## Identify Live Hosts
### Identify Live Hosts

#### Description
Get a list of live hosts.

#### Tools
* Hping
* Fping
* Unix ping
* Windows ping
* Nmap
* traceroute
* tcptraceroute

#### Examples
Using nmap (icmp):
```bash
$ nmap -v -sP 10.3.8.1-50

Starting nmap V. 3.81 (www.insecure.org/nmap/)
Host  (10.3.8.1) appears to be down. 
Host  (10.3.8.2) appears to be down. 
Host  (10.3.8.3) appears to be down. 
Host  (10.3.8.4) appears to be down. 
Host  (10.3.8.5) appears to be up. 
```

Using nmap –sP  with –PE, -PA or –PS switches should yield better results.

Using nmap (tcp):
```bash
$ nmap -sP –vv –PS80 10.3.8.1-50

Starting nmap V. 3.81 (www.insecure.org/nmap/)
Host  (10.3.8.1) appears to be down. 
Host  (10.3.8.2) appears to be down. 
Host  (10.3.8.3) appears to be down. 
Host  (10.3.8.4) appears to be down. 
Host  (10.3.8.5) appears to be up. 
```

Using hping (tcp examples):
```bash
$ hping -S -c 2 10.3.8.5

HPING 10.3.8.5 (eth1 10.3.8.5): S set, 40 headers + 0 data bytes 
len=46 ip=10.3.8.5 ttl=60 id=1650 sport=0 flags=RA seq=0 win=0 rtt=2.8 ms 
len=46 ip=10.3.8.5 ttl=60 id=1651 sport=0 flags=RA seq=1 win=0 rtt=2.4 ms 
```
```bash
$ hping -S -c 2 10.3.8.1

HPING 10.3.8.1 (eth1 10.3.8.1): S set, 40 headers + 0 data bytes 
ICMP Host Unreachable from ip=10.3.8.64 name=UNKNOWN 
ICMP Host Unreachable from ip=10.3.8.64 name=UNKNOWN
