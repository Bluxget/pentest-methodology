# Network Mapping
## Host Enumeration
### System Enumeration

#### Description
Analysis and correlation with other information gathered from scanning test will provide attackers and assessors valuable information to focus further tests and decide where manual tests for vulnerabilities (usually related to configuration issues) should take place.

#### Tools
* Spreadsheets
* Databases
* Logic programming languages (e.g. Prolog)

#### Examples
For each server scanned, fill in the following information (e.g. in a matrix):
* Server IP
* Server FQDN
* List of services discovered (including references to information from Banner Grabbing Aanalysis and Correlation test)
* O.S. fingerprint information (from previous tests)
* Network localization tests (from network mapping tests and traceroutes, if available)

From the above data, you should be able to infer and document the following information for each server: 
* Purpose for business
* Impact of the server in the Targetâ€™s business
* Relationships with other servers and network devices (e.g. trust relationships)

Server IP: 192.168.1.110
Server FQDN: 
Services discovered:
```bash
21/tcp  open  ftp        vsftpd 2.0.4
22/tcp  open  tcpwrapped
22/tcp  open  ssh
631/tcp open  ipp        CUPS 1.1
80/tcp  open  http       Apache httpd 2.2.4 ((Unix) mod_ssl/2.2.4 OpenSSL/0.9.8b DAV/2)
```
           
O.S. fingerprint information:
```bash
Running: Linux 2.6.X
OS CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:2.6
OS details: Linux 2.6.13 - 2.6.32
