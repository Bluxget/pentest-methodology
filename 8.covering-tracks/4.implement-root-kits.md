### Implement Root-Kits

#### Description
Root-kits, like POC exploits, should be customized to be able to completely cover the assessor’s activities. In most cases if there is an AV patrolling, root-kits (usually on win32) will be detected before installation. So, modifying the root-kits is required in most situations. It’s also important to notice that some root-kits won’t work on different system setups. For example your root-kit may work on win2k-SP3 but it can’t cover anything on SP4.
