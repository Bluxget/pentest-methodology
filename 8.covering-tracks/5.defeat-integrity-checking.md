### Defeat Integrity Checking

#### Description
In cases where static integrity checking by systems such as Tripwire has been implemented, it is very difficult to make any changes to the system without those being detected and reported.

However, if the deployment of the system integrity tool was incorrectly done, for example by leaving the file with the signatures of valid files and programs in the same server, it will be possible to modify the system and regenerate the signatures.
