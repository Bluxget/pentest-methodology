### Defeat Anti-Virus

#### Description
Nowadays, on most workstations and servers, there is Anti-Virus software protecting the system against well known malicious software (like exploits, viri, worms, etc); the focus of this step in penetration testing is to be able to disable or defeat AV software so that the assessor is able to perform activities unhindered, and the possibility to reactivate the AV later.

In most centrally managed AV solutions, the AV software is restarted after a certain amount of time when it is stopped by an assessor. The “grace period” allows the assessor to perform several tasks in order that the AV software remains disabled for longer periods of time.

Possible things that assessors can do (most of these require Administrator level access):
* Create a batch file so that the AV services are stopped every 30 sec
* Disable the AV services
* Block the central management port
