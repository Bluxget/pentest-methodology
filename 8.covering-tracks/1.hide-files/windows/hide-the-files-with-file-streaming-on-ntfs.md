### Hide The Files With File Streaming On NTFS

#### Description
On NTFS, any file can be added into another file’s Alternate Data Stream (ADS). As per Microsoft an ADS is, “A mechanism to add additional attributes or information to a file without restructuring the file system” This functionality can be abused if attacker stream malicious file into some non suspicious file.

#### Examples
Hiding and recovering non-binary files:
```powershell
\> type secret.txt > normalfile.doc:secret.txt
\> more < normalfile.doc:secret.txt > secret.txt
```
(As a side note, you can open “nomalfile.doc:secret.txt” with Notepad, that recognizes ADS).

Hiding and recovering binary files:
```powershell
\> cp exploit.exe notepad.exe:exploit.exe
\> cp notepad.exe:exploit.exe exploit.exe
```
(The command cat can be used as well)
