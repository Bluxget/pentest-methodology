## Hide Files (Windows)
### Putting Files Into Un-Accessible Directories

#### Description
In Microsoft Windows systems if the file name/directory name contains some special characters it canâ€™t be opened without prior knowledge of the combination used by the attacker to rename the file/directory.

#### Examples
To create a directory:
```powershell
\> mkdir {name portion}{ALT+254}{name portion}
```
To hide an existing file:
```powershell
\> ren {old name} {new name portion}{ALT+254}{new name portion}
```

Optionally, apply the hidden attribute:
```powershell
\> attrib +h {name created above}
```
